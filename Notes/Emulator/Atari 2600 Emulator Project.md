## Overview
The goal of this project is to create a functional emulator for the Atari 2600. This document outlines the key components and steps needed to build the emulator in C++.

## Components
- [[MOS 6507 CPU Emulation]]
- [[TIA (Television Interface Adapter) Emulation]]
- [[RIOT (RAM-I/O-Timer) Emulation]]

## Development Setup
- Language: C++
- Graphics and Sound Library: SDL
- Development Environment: CLion

## Emulation Components
- [[MOS 6507 CPU Emulation]]
- [[Memory Management]]
- [[TIA (Television Interface Adapter) Emulation]]
- [[Input Handling]]

## Testing and Debugging
- Detailed note on how you plan to test and debug the emulator.

## Additional Features (Optional)
- Save state functionality.
- GUI for the emulator.
- Configurable controls.

### General Hardware Specifications:

- **Processor**: Based on the MOS Technology 6507 chip.
- **Maximum Resolution**: 160 x 192 pixels (NTSC).
- **Color Capability**: 128 colors.
- **RAM**: 128 bytes.
- **Cartridge ROM**: 4 KB (expandable to 64 KB via bank switching)​[](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atari_2600_hardware#:~:text=The%20Atari%202600%20hardware%20was,64%20KB%20via%20bank%20switching)

- ​.

### Memory Architecture:

1. **CPU and Memory Access**:
    
    - The 6507 CPU in the Atari 2600 can directly access 8192 bytes (2^13 bytes) of memory, unlike the standard 6502, which can address 65536 (2^16) bytes. This limitation arises because only 13 of the 16 address lines are connected to physical memory​[](https://www.randomterrain.com/atari-2600-memories-tutorial-andrew-davie-05.html)

- - ​.
- **RAM**:
    
    - The Atari 2600 has 128 bytes of RAM located at memory addresses `$80` to `$FF`​[](https://www.randomterrain.com/atari-2600-memories-tutorial-andrew-davie-05.html)
- - ​.
- **Memory Mapping**:
    
    - **TIA Registers**: Mapped in the memory addresses range `0x0000` to `0x007F`. The Television Interface Adaptor (TIA) is responsible for the Atari 2600's graphics and sound.
    - **RAM**: Accessible in the range `0x0080` to `0x00FF`.
    - **RIOT Registers**: Located from `0x0280` to `0x02FF`. The RIOT chip handles timers, I/O, and additional RAM.
    - **Cartridge ROM**: Typically mapped into the address range `0x1000` to `0x1FFF`, which is a 4K size. This can be extended through bank switching techniques​[](https://www.randomterrain.com/atari-2600-memories-tutorial-andrew-davie-05.html#:~:text=Don%27t%20worry%20too%20much%20about,10000000000%20bytes)
